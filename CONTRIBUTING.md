# Contributing to The Everything Tool

First of all, thank you for your interest in this project.

This is my first public project, and it’s still at an early stage.  
Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome — as long as they align with the spirit of the tool.

## Project philosophy

The Everything Tool aims to:
- simplify access to real security tools
- respect original tool authors
- stay clean, readable, and transparent
- remain focused on learning and ethical use

Quality matters more than quantity.

## How to contribute

### Suggestions / ideas
If you have:
- an idea for a feature
- a tool you think should be added
- a design or structure suggestion

Please open an **Issue** and explain:
- what the idea is
- why it adds value
- who it is for (beginner / intermediate / advanced)

---

### Code contributions

Code contributions are done **via Pull Requests only**.

Before submitting a PR:
- make sure the code is readable
- avoid unnecessary complexity
- follow the existing structure and style
- test your changes if possible

Pull requests may be refused if they:
- add low-quality or redundant tools
- include unethical or illegal use cases
- install tools from unofficial or modified sources
- significantly reduce readability or simplicity

This is not personal — it’s about keeping the project clean.

## Tool additions guidelines

If you propose adding a tool:
- it must come from the **official repository**
- it must be relevant to cybersecurity or related fields
- it must not be malware, cracked software, or piracy-related
- it should bring real value (not just “because it exists”)

Please include:
- a short description
- the official source link
- the category it belongs to

---

## Ethics

This project is intended for:
- learning
- research
- ethical security testing

Anything clearly malicious or illegal will be refused.

## Credit & recognition

All contributors are credited through GitHub history.  
Significant contributions may also be mentioned in the README or documentation.

## Communication

Be respectful.
No ego.
No gatekeeping.
Everyone is learning — including me.

If something is unclear, just ask.

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.
