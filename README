# The Everything Tool

Hi,  
I’m Kahunser, a cybersecurity student, and this is my first public project.

**The Everything Tool** is a simple Python-based program designed to make discovering, installing, and using security tools easier — especially for people who are learning, but also for more experienced users who want something clean and centralized.

Yes, I know there are already Linux distributions that come with preinstalled and preconfigured tools.  
The idea here is different: no long setup, no full OS to install — just install the tool you need (on almost any OS) and start using it.

---

## What is this tool?

The idea is simple:

- One tool to centralize others
- Clear, menu-based navigation
- Multiple categories
- Real tools, installed from their **official sources**
- Open-source, transparent, and improvable by anyone

Instead of spending time searching, cloning repositories, fixing dependencies, or remembering commands, the goal is to **focus on learning, testing, and practicing**.

Everything runs through a menu interface to keep things readable and easy to use.

## Tool categories

Tools are organized by category (recon, exploitation, OSINT, etc.).

> At the moment, the list is empty — this project is still at the beginning.  
> As tools are added, a full and detailed list will be available here.

## Ethics & transparency

- This project is **100% open-source**
- All installations use the **original developers’ repositories**
- No modified binaries
- No hidden code

This tool is meant for **learning, research, and ethical security testing only**.

## Contributing / ideas

If you:
- have a tool you’d like to see added
- want to suggest an improvement
- or just want to discuss the project

You can:
- open an issue on GitHub  
- contact me by email: kahunser@proton.me  
- reach out on X (Twitter): @kahunser  

Even simple feedback helps a lot.

## Why I made this

I’m still learning too.  
This project exists because I believe the best way to grow in cybersecurity is to **build things and share them**.

If this tool helps even a few people save time or learn something new, then it’s already worth it.

Thanks for checking it out.
